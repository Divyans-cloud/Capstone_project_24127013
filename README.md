🚀 OpenLearn Cohort 1.0 Capstone Project — End-to-end Machine Learning workflows (Classification, Regression, and Unsupervised Learning) built from scratch, converted to Python scripts, and integrated into a Streamlit web app for interactive model testing and visualization.

Capstone Project 2025
Project Title: Mental Wellness Analysis and Support Strategy

This is a machine learning based app that i created as a part of my personal learning journey at OpenlearnCohort. It includes both supervised and unsupervised ML models, and also have a simple demo interface to interact with models.

📝 Project Description
This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving workplace well-being. It uses machine learning techniques to perform classification, regression, and clustering tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Objectives
To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and build data-driven solutions for:

Classification Task: Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.
Regression Task: Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.
Unsupervised Task: Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies
