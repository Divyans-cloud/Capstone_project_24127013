📝 Project Description
This project aims to understand key factors influencing mental health among tech employees and build data-driven solutions for improving workplace well-being. It uses machine learning techniques to perform classification, regression, and clustering tasks and presents results via an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Objectives
To understand the key factors influencing mental health issues among employees in the tech industry and build data-driven solutions for:

Classification Task: Predict whether an individual is likely to seek mental health treatment.
Regression Task: Predict the age of an individual based on personal and workplace attributes, supporting age-targeted intervention design.
Unsupervised Task: Segment tech employees into distinct clusters based on mental health indicators to aid in tailored HR policies
