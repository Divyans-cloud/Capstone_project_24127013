*Findings from  EDA Analysis*

1.Mental Health Treatment by Age Group
    Highest treatment seeking is in the 26–35 age group.
    Very few in the 46+ age groups seek treatment.

2.Impact of Work Interference
    People who report “Often” or “Sometimes” work interference have a much higher rate of seeking treatment.
    Those who report “Never” interference rarely seek treatment.

3.Impact of Company Benefits
    Employees with mental health benefits are more likely to seek treatment.
    Uncertainty (“Don’t know” about benefits) is linked to lower treatment rates.
    Lack of benefits corresponds to fewer people seeking help.



*Findings from Classification Model*
    The model achieved 61.51% accuracy with balanced precision (0.61) and recall (0.57).
    It performs slightly better at identifying class 0 than class 1.
    Misclassifications are fairly even across both classes, suggesting scope for improvement through feature tuning or model optimization.




*Findings from Regression Model*
    The regression model shows an MAE of 6.17 and RMSE of 8.07, indicating notable prediction errors.
    A negative R² score (-0.19) suggests the model performs worse than a simple mean-based prediction.
    This highlights the need for better feature selection or model tuning.




*Findings from Unsupervised Model*
    The Elbow Method graph shows a sharp drop in inertia from k=1 to k=2, after which the curve flattens significantly.
    This suggests that 2 clusters is the optimal choice for segmenting the dataset, as adding more clusters yields minimal improvement.
    The clear elbow at k=2 indicates strong separability between the groups in the data.
